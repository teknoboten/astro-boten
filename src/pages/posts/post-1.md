So I have decided to try and find an actual job working with people again! I am very excited about this idea but job hunting - after being "mommy tracked" for a few more years than anticipated, and also during a "recession" where A.I. is coming to take all the jorbs - is the worst.

So in between hacking cover letters to try and convince H.R. bots to talk to me, I decided to bolster my spirits by playing around with Jekyll. Because when you have something important to do, you should definitely start a new personal project using a bunch of tools you are not familiar with, right?

Anyway, I eventually got it deployed, but it took sooooo long because of reasons and dependancies and Ruby... Ok, it's because I decided to use a custom Gem based theme, which wasn't supported by the default Github Pages deploy action, so I had to spend a bunch of time learning about actions and Ruby, which took forever and still has a bunch of dependancy errors which I decided probably weren't worth troubleshooting.

The cool thing I got to do during that process was use _markdown_ to write _blog posts_. I also learned about _front matter_ which together, are AWESOME. Yes, I am late to the party again. But after I got the Jekyll site deployed, I started trying to do some basic styling and I immediately realized not being able to easily customize and change and add things was going to drive me nuts.

But this brings me to Astro, and this blog. I love building with React so I am excited to try this whole "component island" concept out. And also, that I am supposed to be packing for a camping trip so I have to go now.

## TLDR

1. Hello, I have a new blog!
2. Writing code is fun!
3. I have to go pack now!
